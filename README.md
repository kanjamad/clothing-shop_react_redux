## Crwn clothing

-   Gonna have navigation and routing that takes us to different pages of categories of items and from these items
-   We're actually going to be able to add them to our cart and from our car.
-   We're actually going to see these things directly update and
    from this car we're gonna be able to checkout increase or decrease these items again and see the live changes in both our checkout page and our car page remove items.
-   Integrate with a stripe API so that we can handle payments.
-   Integrate with firebase to handle our authentication and our storage.
    So with firebase, we're actually going to be able to authorize our users using Google so that we can sign in with our Google accounts and
    once we sign in we're also going to provide a sign feature and a signup and sign in with email and password feature.
-   So it's gonna be a really fleshed out fully complete e-commerce platform just like you would build for a real e-commerce company
